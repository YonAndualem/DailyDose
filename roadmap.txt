# DailyDose React Native App Integration Roadmap

This is a step-by-step plan to connect your blank React Native app to your backend and build a modern quotes app.

---

## 1. **Project Setup**
- [*] Ensure a blank React Native (Expo) project is ready with a clean `/app/index.tsx`.
- [*] Confirm project runs on device/emulator and loads a simple text screen.

---

## 2. **API Setup**
- [*] Decide on and document your backend API base URL (local/production).
- [*] Create a `utils/api.ts` to encapsulate all backend API calls.
- [*] Test fetching a daily quote from `GET /api/quotes/daily`.

## 3. **Basic Home Screen**
- [ ] Build a basic Home screen that:
    - [ ] Fetches and displays the daily quote from the backend.
    - [ ] Shows loading and error states.
    - [ ] Has a "Reload" button to fetch a new quote.

---

## 4. **Quote Model & Local State**
- [ ] Define a TypeScript type/interface for quotes.
- [ ] Store currently fetched quote in state.
- [ ] (Optional) Keep a session-based quote history in state.

---

## 5. **Favorites Functionality**
- [ ] Implement local favorites (using AsyncStorage).
- [ ] Add a "Favorite" button to the Home screen.
- [ ] Create a Favorites screen to view, remove, and share favorites.

---

## 6. **Navigation**
- [ ] Add bottom tab navigation with:
    - [ ] Home
    - [ ] Favorites
    - [ ] (Optional: Explore/Categories, Settings)

---

## 7. **Categories & More**
- [ ] Fetch and display quote categories from `GET /api/categories`.
- [ ] Allow filtering quotes by category (optional).
- [ ] (Optional) Add an Explore screen to browse quotes/categories.

---

## 8. **Theming and Polish**
- [ ] Add basic light/dark mode support.
- [ ] Polish UI with styling and icons.
- [ ] Add sharing (native Share API) and copy-to-clipboard.

---

## 9. **Testing and Error Handling**
- [ ] Add robust error handling for all network/API actions.
- [ ] Test UX on Android, iOS, and (optionally) web.

---

## 10. **Stretch Goals**
- [ ] Daily notification with a motivational quote.
- [ ] Home screen widget (Android).
- [ ] Multi-device sync of favorites/history (requires backend support).

---

## 11. **Deployment**
- [ ] Test with production backend.
- [ ] Prepare for App Store/Play Store publishing (icons, splash screen, privacy, etc.).
